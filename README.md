# Pimoroni_Badger_Badge
New Apps for the Pimoroni Badge RPi 240 badge

## hp_bar.py
This is a simple display that shows a HP bar and a username on the screen. Buttons on the badge increase or decrease the bar

*  Press 'Up' or 'C' to increase the HP bar
*  Press 'Down' or 'A' to decrease the HP bar
*  Press 'B' to invert the display

Change the `USER_CONFIGURED_NAME` variable in the script to change the text on the right side of the display to what you want to display.

Name the script `ebook.py` and place it on the badge to replace the Ebook reader app so you can launch the app without having to add more apps to the default launcher
